It provides a comprehensive overview of the best practices and objectives for improving agent performance through context reduction and delegation strategies.\n\nCHUNK 2: This chunk is a partial excerpt of the same document, specifically the beginning of the \"Summary\" section, which is cut off. It situates within the overall document as an incomplete part of the introductory explanation of the PRP, likely intended to elaborate on the \"Reduce\" principle before the full details are provided.\n\nCHUNK 3: This chunk details a specific phase (\"Phase B — Delegate (Sub‑agents)\") focusing on the process of sub-agent document/web ingestion, including the workflow steps, command usage, and the gate condition. It situates within the document as a procedural example of delegation practices for handling token-heavy\\n\\n# PRP — Mastering Context Engineering for Agent Performance (R&D Best Practices)\n\n**Owner:** Ciaran Cox  \n**Date:** 2025‑09‑10  \n**Goal:** Implement a repeatable Reduce & Delegate (R&D) context‑engineering workflow that produces faster, more reliable, and cheaper agent runs by shrinking the primary context window and offloading heavy work to focused agents.\n\n## 1) Summary (Why / What)\nA focused agent is a performant agent. This PRP operationalizes R&D best practices:\n- **Reduce** what enters the primary agent’s context at boot and during loops.\n- **Delegate** token‑heavy tasks to sub‑agents or background primary agents and persist outcomes as files/bundles.\n\n**Desired outcome:** Boot with a slim, universal memory; load only task‑specific tools/context on demand; orchestrate sub‑agents/background agents for heavy I/O; maintain replayable **context bundles** so work continues cleanly after context explosions.\n\n## 2) Success Criteria (Definition of Done)\n1. **Boot budget:** Primary agent starts with ≥90% free context; always‑on memory ≤500 tokens.\n2. **MCP hygiene:** No default MCP servers autoloaded; task runs pass in an explicit MCP config.\n3. **Priming over memory:** Task types use **prime commands** (bug/feature/docs/CC) to read only the minimal files needed.\n4. **Delegation:** Web/doc reads and other token‑heavy steps run in **sub‑agents** or **background primary agents** and write artifacts to disk.\n5. **Context bundles:** Each significant run writes an append‑only bundle (prompt + reads + key findings). A new agent can **/load** a bundle to remount state to ~70% without re‑reading everything.\n6. **Reporting:** Background agents write to a report file and rename it on completion.\n\n## 3) Scope / Non‑Goals\n- **In scope:** Agent context hygiene, MCP configuration discipline, priming commands, sub‑agent workflows, background agent delegation, context bundle logging, Makefile/CLI wrappers, CI lint.\n- **Out of scope:** New product features beyond these workflow changes; model/provider swaps; IDE migration.\n\n## 4) Inputs & Artifacts\n**Inputs**\n- Existing repo and Claude‑style slash‑command support.\n- Optional MCP servers (e.g., web fetch / Firecrawl) available but **not** autoloaded.\n\n**Artifacts produced**\n- `memory/concise.md` — tiny universal memory file.\n- `.claude/commands/prime_*.md` — reusable primes (bug, feature, docs, cc).\n- `.claude/commands/background.md` — fires a background instance + report file.\n- `.claude/commands/load_ai_docs.md` — sub‑agent doc ingestion.\n- `.claude/commands/load_bundle.md` — remount prior state.\n- `agents/context-bundles/…` — append‑only run trails.\n- `reports/**` — status & outputs from background/prime runs.\n- `configs/mcp/firecrawl.json` — example strict per‑task MCP config.\n- `scripts/lint_memory.py` — CI lint for memory size.\n- `scripts/context_bundle_writer.py`, `scripts/load_bundle.py` — bundle utilities.\n- `Makefile` — convenience wrappers.\n- `.github/workflows/lint-memory.yml` — CI enforcement.\n\n## 5) Constraints & Risks\n- **Risk (coordination):** Sub‑agent chatter or oversized outputs can re‑bloat context.  \n  **Mitigation:** Return **summaries + file paths**, not raw dumps.\n- **Risk (memory creep):** Teams expand universal memory over time.  \n  **Mitigation:** Hard cap lines/tokens; everything else moves to primes.\n- **Risk (tool sprawl):** Loading many MCP servers “just in case.”  \n  **Mitigation:** Enforce explicit per‑task MCP configs.\n\n## 6) Implementation Plan (R&D in action)\n\n### Phase A — Reduce\n1. **Kill default MCP autoload**\n   - Remove `default.mcp.json` (or equivalent).\n   - Create per‑task configs (e.g., `configs/mcp/firecrawl.json`).\n   - Run tasks with a strict flag in your tool (e.g., `--strict-mcp-config <path>`).\n\n2. **Slim universal memory**\n   - Replace the giant always‑on memory file with `memory/concise.md` (≤50 lines).\n   - Keep only **universal, always‑true** rules (style, output format, safety, short glossary).\n   - Add a CI check that fails if the file exceeds token/line caps.\n\n3. **Adopt context priming**\n   - Add primes:\n     - `.claude/commands/prime_bug.md`\n     - `.claude/commands/prime_feature.md`\n     - `.claude/commands/prime_docs.md`\n     - `.claude/commands/prime_cc.md`\n   - **Prime template (all primes follow this):**\n     - **Purpose** — one‑line intent.\n     - **Run** — minimal steps for this task type.\n     - **Read** — explicit file list/globs (keep tiny).\n     - **Report** — where to write status/summary.\n\n**Gate A:** Boot context free ≥90%; memory ≤500 tokens; no MCP servers loaded by default.","metadata":{"url":"file://PRP.md","tags":["prp","project"],"source":"file_PRP_md_6032efe2","headers":"# PRP — Mastering Context Engineering for Agent Performance (R&D Best Practices); ## 1)

point of this is not to feel bad about yourself or your message if it sounds like the above. Just because your message isn’t up to snuff, doesn't mean that what you’re offering isn't valuable. \nIt’s a process that requires refining over time based on your experience, growth, and targeting. \nJust look at Maya’s.\n![Maya Elious' brand messaging over the years](https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2Fd5e2d72a033944e1a916c5c34902a1ff%2F9fbee488a0af4ef697833b8435fc63df?width=866)\n“Good messaging is not about people-pleasing,” says Maya. “It’s about communicating the value that you add to a specific industry that you have expertise in. Stop trying to save everyone.”\n## The playbook\nIf you’ve never thought about how your brand comes across online, or used to think it’s just “marketing fluff”—think again. \nThe entrepreneurs (and millionaires) from our past playbooks—Codie Sanchez and Ali Abdaal—have laser-focused messaging across their entire web presence. They know who they’re speaking to, what’s special about what they bring to the table, and how they uniquely solve their target audience’s problems.\nSo, how do you get your brand’s messaging to millionaire status?\n### Maya’s Dating Method\n“Your messaging, like dating, is trial & error.” - Maya Elious\nWhen you’re dating, your headspace will change how you approach choosing partners: **Are you desperate—or picky?**\nWhen you’re desperate or unsure about yourself, you don’t have a filter. You date anybody.\n“In my 20s, my standards were way lower. It was like, if you like Jesus and tequila, we can date!” says Maya.\n“But with time, as you get more confident in who you are and really clear on what type and quality of person you want? You start to quickly exclude unfit candidates.”\n![Maya's must haves for dating and clients](https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2Fd5e2d72a033944e1a916c5c34902a1ff%2Ff35e5bb1673948278782e6a72fea9773?width=866)\nWhen you’re confident about what you want and what you bring to the table, your options decrease because not everybody fits your criteria. \nThis is a good thing—and it comes with time, experience, and wisdom.\n“There were like 4 people left in Atlanta for me,” said Maya. “But I would rather have a conversation with four quality people than waste my energy talking to 16 bad-fit people. This is how I want you to think about your messaging.”\n### 5 Tips for applying the Dating Method\nThe goal with crystal clear messaging is to feel SO confident selling your services or courses, you worry about your potential customers missing out on the transformations you could get for them. \n  1. **Narrow your niche**. Set yourself up for success by [going niche](https://circle.so/blog/how-to-find-your-niche). The top 3 most profitable industries are health, wealth, and self. \n     * Health: Holistic wellness, personal training, weight loss, nutrition From wellness coach > holistic coach who helps people lose weight naturally. \n     * Wealth: Money mindset, career coaching From career coach > Career coach for mid-career professionals who want to increase their salary by $25k \n     * Self & relationships: Romantic, familial, self-relationships. From relationship coach > Relationship coach for those in relationships 7+ years \n  2. **Define your audience**. Your target customer is either a version of who you once were, or a group of people your heart is drawn to and for whom you can solve a very specific problem. If you’re confused about who your audience is, take a look back in time 5-7 years to who you used to be. \n  3. **Position your value**. Value is subjective. Just because you think something is valuable, doesn’t mean someone else will. That’s why to show value, you have to acknowledge what your customer wants. If you want to know whether your ideal customer thinks your messaging or offer is valuable… you have to understand: \n     * What do they deeply desire? \n     * What is the pain point that they're dealing with? (As a result of not having what they want.) \n     * What is the transformation or outcome that they're looking for when they come to you? What’s the consequence of not getting their desire or getting rid of their pain? \n  4. **Package your offer**. [Your offer](https://circle.so/blog/building-a-core-offer)—what your customer will buy—can be free to start, and paid to follow. The key is keeping it super clear and “you HAVE TO SAY THE PRICE!” says Maya, because if you don’t have something to sell, you can’t monetize your message. \n  5. **Differentiate your brand**. It’s important to start out in a competitive and saturated market. If it’s saturated, that means you’re in a profitable industry. What can make you different? \n     * People you target\n     * Level of experience\n     * Brand story\n     * Statistics of your company","metadata":{"url":"https://circle.so/blog/brand-messaging-framework","tags":[],"title":"","source_id":"4012484c9956f5e7","char_count":4794,"chunk_size":4794,"crawl_type":"webpage","word_count":737,"chunk_index":4,"description":"","knowledge_type":"technical"},"source_id":"4012484c9956f5e7","similarity":0.000943396240472794,"match_type":"keyword"}],"query":"success criteria","source":null,"match_count":20,"total_found":3,"execution_path":"keyword_only"}
