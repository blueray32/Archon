# BMAD ↔ Archon Agents Mapping
- **Business (B)** → Analyst, PM
- **Model (M)** → Architect (system), Dev (implementation)
- **Automation (A)** → Dev (scripts/agents), QA (checks)
- **Delivery (D)** → Scrum Master (slicing), QA (acceptance), PM (comms)

Usage: Each PRP must list the BMAD facet it advances and reference the responsible agent mode.
