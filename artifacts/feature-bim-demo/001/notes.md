# BIM Standards Implementation - PRP 001

## Summary
Created foundational BIM standards files and validation framework per PRP requirements.

## Files Created
- `data/bim/standards/naming.yml` - Family and type naming patterns
- `data/bim/standards/sheets.yml` - Sheet numbering and title standards
- `scripts/revit/validate_naming.py` - Validator stub for standards compliance

## Files Modified
- `ai_docs/PRDs/feature-bim-demo/ARCH.md` - Added Naming Standards section with links
- `README.md` - Added BIM Standards link

## Key Standards Established
- Family names: CamelCase (e.g., Doors, Windows)
- Type names: Snake_Case (e.g., D_Internal_Fire_30)
- Sheet numbering: A-### format with structured titles
- Type Marks: Must be unique within categories

## Next Steps
Future PRPs will implement full validation logic and Revit integration.
